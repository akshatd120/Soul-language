# Soul Programming Language Compiler

Welcome to the official repository for the Soul Programming Language Compiler!

## About Soul Programming Language

Soul is an exciting hobby programming language project that is actively in development. It is designed for the purpose of learning compiler design technology. **_Although it's still a work in progress._**

## Compiler Overview

This repository hosts the source code and development efforts for the Soul programming language compiler. The compiler, currently implemented in C++, is a critical component in bringing Soul to life. The key details about the compiler are as follows:

- **Programming Language:** The compiler is primarily written in C++ for its performance and low-level capabilities.

- **Self-Hosted:** One of our primary goals is to make the compiler self-hosted, which means it will be capable of compiling its own source code. This is an ambitious and exciting step in the development process.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring the Soul programming language and its compiler, you can start by:

1. **Cloning this Repository:** Get the latest source code and updates by cloning this repository.
